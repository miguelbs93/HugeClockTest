# HugeClockTest
iOS Test

Thank you again for giving me the opportunity to work on this challenge. 
The project is using MVVM architecture and is organised in Folders that could represent each Flow in its own Module. (E.g:
clock module, timer module, reminders module)

I also have used combine, and i'm aware that i might have not used it properly, but its my first time working with combine and learning the process.
I used CoreData for persistence.
I included some unit tests, but wasn't able to cover all components.
